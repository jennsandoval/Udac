    "#### Project 3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data\n",
    "The dataset that I chose to analyze for this project was Denver, CO, and I chose to use the SQL method to query the data. I am originally from Colorado so I was interested to research the Denver dataset and explore new information that I did not know before about Denver. I initially downloaded the XML file from the Openstreetmap website. The file size that was downloaded was extremely large and would take several hours to cleanse and analyze, so I utilized the code titled \"create_sample_size\" within the folder to generate a \"sample\" file so that the file size became around 54 MB. The smaller file size was much easier to capture a \"small\" picutre of the data and get a well rounded idea as to the set up of the dataset, find any discrepancies, and perform additional queries to explore the area."

    "One improvement that I noticed is to update the titles of the map area that is being captured. I do think that if the map title was updated to \"Denver and Boulder, CO and Surrounding Areas\", it would help alleviate confusion while querying the data that other areas outside the Metropolitan area are also being included. While I was auditing the data, I was finding cities and counties were included in the OSM file that were not located in the Dever Metropolitan area, such as Cleark Creek County, which is located about 20 miles to the west of Denver. This will be beneifical to truly identify anomalies within the data.\n",
    "Another imporvement that I found while working with this dataset is that I noticed while I was querying the data that some bike paths were included, however I think that connecting the Openstreet Map data to an app such as Strava could expand even more on the bikepaths as road cycling and mountain biking are very prominent activies in the area. I think being able to connect the Openstreetmap to another app so that missing pieces of data that might exist in either the Openstreetmap source or the app can be filled in as well as ensure the data is staying up to date as some areas of the map might be updated more frequently than others. The last imporvement that I found is to standardize the allowed data input format when contributors input their data so there is a less likely chance of errors occurring. There could also be a script that cleanses the data more frequently so that abbreviations and phone number formats are remaining consistent. This improvement would help alleviate the data from becoming muddled and allow for more time to analyze the data. "
