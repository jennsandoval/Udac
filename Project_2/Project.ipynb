The questions that I posed were to understand what three factors had the highest impact on the chance of survival for the passengers. I focused my analysis on the gender of the passenger, the class of ticket that was purchased, as well as the age of the passengers. I did find in the dataset that there were passengers whose age were not known, so I performed my age analysis on passengers whose ages were known. My steps to analyzing the data are described below. My analysis can be found below."
